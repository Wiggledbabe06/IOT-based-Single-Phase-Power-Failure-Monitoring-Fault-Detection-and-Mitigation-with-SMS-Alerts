# IOT-based-Single-Phase-Power-Failure-Monitoring-Fault-Detection-and-Mitigation-with-SMS-Alerts.
**Project Objective:** To develop a IoT-based system for single-phase power supply to detect faults & mitigate damage by breaking the circuit in realtime to enhance grid reliability and protect equipment.To develop a IoT-based system for single-phase power supply to detect faults & mitigate damage by breaking the circuit in realtime to enhance grid reliability and protect equipment.
## Tools & technologies used:
OS : Ubuntu
Programming Language : Embedded C.

Libraries required to program ESP8266 & DHT11 : ESP8266HTTPClient.h, ESP8266WiFi.h, ArduinoJson.h, time.h, DHT.h.

Hardware required : ESP8266 Micro-controller, DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.

## Project Description
The ESP8266-DHT11 Sensor Network project aims to create a system for real-time collection of temperature and humidity data and local storage using a RESTful API. The proposed system will consist of multiple ESP8266 microcontrollers connected to DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors, which will collect data at regular intervals and transmit it to a central server.
